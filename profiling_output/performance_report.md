# Evolution Simulation Performance Report

Generated on: Sun Aug  3 15:53:58 BST 2025

## Summary

This report contains performance analysis results for the evolution simulation.

## Files Generated

- `flamegraph.svg`: CPU usage flamegraph (if available)
- `memory_profile.txt`: Memory usage analysis (if available)
- `analysis.txt`: Detailed performance analysis
- `profile_*.log`: Individual profiling runs

## Recommendations

Based on the profiling results, consider the following optimizations:

1. **Spatial Grid Optimization**: If grid operations are slow, consider:
   - Adjusting cell size
   - Using a more efficient spatial data structure
   - Implementing grid partitioning

2. **Entity Processing**: If entity processing is slow, consider:
   - Reducing the number of nearby entity checks
   - Optimizing interaction calculations
   - Using more efficient algorithms

3. **Memory Usage**: If memory usage is high, consider:
   - Reducing entity count
   - Optimizing data structures
   - Implementing object pooling

4. **Parallelization**: If single-threaded operations are slow, consider:
   - Increasing parallel processing
   - Optimizing thread pool usage
   - Reducing synchronization overhead

## Next Steps

1. Review the flamegraph for CPU bottlenecks
2. Check memory profile for memory leaks
3. Analyze specific slow operations
4. Implement targeted optimizations
5. Re-run profiling to measure improvements
