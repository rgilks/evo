# Evolution Simulation

A beautiful and performant evolution simulation written in Rust, featuring an Entity Component System (ECS) with parallel processing and GPU-accelerated graphics. Watch as complex behaviors emerge naturally from simple genetic rules!

## Features

- **Entity Component System**: Uses the `hecs` crate for efficient entity management
- **Parallel Processing**: Leverages `rayon` to maximize performance on multi-core systems
- **GPU Graphics**: Beautiful real-time visualization using `wgpu`
- **Headless Mode**: Run simulations without UI for testing and analysis
- **Emergent Behaviors**: Complex predator-prey dynamics emerge from simple genetic rules
- **Population Balance**: Sophisticated population control mechanisms prevent explosions
- **Stable Physics**: Advanced boundary handling and drift correction

## Evolution Mechanics

### Gene-Based Behaviors
Instead of predefined entity types, all behaviors emerge from genes:

- **Speed**: Movement velocity and hunting effectiveness
- **Sense Radius**: Detection range for food and threats
- **Energy Efficiency**: How efficiently energy is used and stored
- **Reproduction Rate**: Likelihood of successful reproduction
- **Mutation Rate**: How much genes change in offspring
- **Size Factor**: How size relates to energy requirements
- **Energy Loss Rate**: Base energy consumption per tick
- **Energy Gain Rate**: Efficiency of consuming other entities
- **Color**: Visual representation of genetic traits (HSV-based)

### Emergent Interactions
- **Predation**: Based on relative speed and size advantages
- **Energy Transfer**: Efficient energy gain with diminishing returns
- **Population Control**: Density-based reproduction and death rates
- **Size Constraints**: Natural limits prevent oversized entities

## Usage

### With UI (Default)

```bash
cargo run
```

### Headless Mode (Console Only)

```bash
cargo run -- --headless --steps 1000 --world-size 1000
```

### Command Line Options

- `--headless`: Run without graphics (faster for testing)
- `--steps <number>`: Number of simulation steps in headless mode (default: 1000)
- `--world-size <number>`: Size of the simulation world (default: 1000)

## Performance Optimizations

The simulation is heavily optimized for performance:

- **Rayon Parallelization**: 
  - Entity updates processed in parallel
  - Spatial grid data extraction parallelized
  - Metrics collection parallelized
  - Update preparation parallelized
- **Spatial Grid**: O(n¬≤) ‚Üí O(n) complexity for entity interactions
- **Efficient ECS**: Hecs for fast entity queries and updates
- **GPU Acceleration**: WGPU for smooth real-time graphics

## Simulation Rules

### Core Mechanics
1. **Energy System**: All entities consume energy over time based on size and activity
2. **Movement**: Entities move toward targets within their sense radius
3. **Predation**: Larger/faster entities can consume smaller/slower ones
4. **Reproduction**: High-energy entities reproduce with genetic mutations
5. **Population Control**: Density-based reproduction suppression and death rates
6. **Size Constraints**: Entities are limited to reasonable size ranges

### Advanced Features
- **Boundary Handling**: Smart boundary detection with centering forces
- **Drift Prevention**: Position validation and correction mechanisms
- **Stable Spawning**: Uniform distribution prevents initial bias
- **Balanced Growth**: Multiple mechanisms prevent population explosions

## Technical Architecture

### ECS Components
- **Position**: 2D coordinates with boundary validation
- **Energy**: Current and maximum energy levels
- **Size**: Radius-based size with constraints
- **Velocity**: Movement vector with physics validation
- **Color**: RGB color derived from genetic traits
- **Genes**: Inheritable traits that define behavior

### Key Systems
- **Spatial Grid**: Efficient neighbor finding and collision detection
- **Parallel Processing**: Rayon-based parallel entity updates
- **Boundary Management**: Advanced boundary handling with drift correction
- **Population Control**: Multi-layered population balance mechanisms
